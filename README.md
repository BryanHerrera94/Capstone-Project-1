# Capstone-Project-1
This is my First project, I am attempting to make a basic Web page using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

![HomePage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130613587/233519788-fe293bc2-7c1f-4820-8d44-06e327fd77f4.png)


This is my Home page. I went with a simple navigation bar on top of the page. It includes a home button with a dropdown
button that leads to a checkout page, there is also a product button that leads to the product page and a Login button that has
a drop down menu which will show a sign up button. At the far left is my Logo for the page.
Next will be my home page Picture which has my logo "MacDaddy" on it. It was good practice since I had to use Canva to create and
edit my logo onto the picture. Then created an image source code to create a link and assign it a class so it would be easy to 
make adjustments to it in CSS. Next will be my two paragraphs, all I did was create two containers to hold the text and then added a
Gif to one of them just to see how it would turn out.

Next up is my product page. I used the same code for my navigation bar so all my pages can look somewhat consistent. This one wasn't
too hard, I just found a code for "cards" on the Bootstrap website and added an extra "Add to cart" button. After that I linked an 
Image to each and every card and wrote a brief description for the product. One of the problems I ran into was creating a class for 
the background image because I wanted a different image for this page. I was short on time so the quickest solution I came up with
was to create a seperate style page which made things tremendously easier for me since I didn't have to wonder why my other images 
were getting messed up when I would try to style a specefic image.

This is the checkout page, I started by making a simple table to place the products someone would order. I used the Table class and
I really struggled at first to make rows and headers but eventually understood how to make a proper table

Next is my login page, I went with a similar approach to my checkout page. I started with a container and made rows for the information  
you would input

I also linked this HTML page with my home page style sheet so it can have the same background. It also uses the same navigation bar
as my homepage. You can also click on the "Forgot Password" and "Need an account? Sign up here" button and it will take you 
to the pages you wish to go to.

For this page I used an HTML code that creates a form with a field for email input and a submit button. When the user 
enters their email and clicks the submit button. After that I used the <footer> header so I can make it a specific class and 
insert a GIF. I used a class element on the footer so I can mess with it and style the GIF in CSS.

This is my Sign up page, I used an HTML code that creates a form for user sign-up with input fields for name and email address. 
The form is enclosed within a Bootstrap layout structure consisting of a container, row, and columns.Overall, this code creates a 
sign-up form with fields for name and email address, enclosed within a Bootstrap container and card for styling and layout purposes.
